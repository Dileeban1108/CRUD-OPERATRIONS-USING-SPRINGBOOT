# Spring Boot CRUD Operations API

## Description
This project is a **Spring Boot** application that demonstrates basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on a database. It exposes a RESTful API, allowing clients to perform CRUD actions on resources such as users, products, or any other entity.

The project uses **Spring Data JPA** for data persistence and **MySQL** as the relational database.

## Features
- **Create**: Add a new resource to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve all resources or a specific resource by ID.
- **Update**: Modify an existing resource.
- **Delete**: Remove a resource from the database.
- **REST API**: Exposes endpoints for external applications to interact with the database.
